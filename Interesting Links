FFTW Package (Most popular on stackoverflow for very fast fft)- http://www.fftw.org/
Intel's FFT Package (possibly faster than fftw but might only be for intel chips) - https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl/features/fft
Sliding DFT (allegedly faster than fft methods for real-time, looks promising ) - https://github.com/bronsonp/SlidingDFT
